#Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
#Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code.
#Example
if 2>1:
    print("Two is greater than One")
